# 🧊 PyPCMB - Optimize Phase Change Materials in Buildings

PyPCMB is a Python-based tool designed to help architects, engineers, and energy modelers integrate **Phase Change Materials (PCMs)** into building components—walls, roofs, and floors—for **maximum energy efficiency** and **enhanced thermal comfort**.

Powered by scientific principles and practical algorithms, PyPCMB provides intelligent recommendations based on building geometry, climate, and material properties.
